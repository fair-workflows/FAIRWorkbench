# Ideas

## Entry in jupyter notebook cell
* Markup is generated in the cell corresponding to the RDF description of the manual step.
* A "results" input section of the cell allows user to input URI of expected/resultant data sets.
* Once output of manual task is specified, notebook may continue execution.

## CWL tool
* Optionally, command line prompt, or GUI prompt?
* Contact an expert? Several ways:
    * Contact a server, which processes the request and contacts the relevant expert, displaying the steps required, and giving them a graphical interface in which the desired results may be entered.
    * Emails the specified expert directly, with the instructions. Expert may reply to the email.


Test CWL manual tool with
```cwl-runner --preserve-entire-environment test_workflow.cwl --manual_mode commandline```
